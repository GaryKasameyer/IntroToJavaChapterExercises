 (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
 problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from
 a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
 a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
 before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
 before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
 to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
 card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:

 Queen of Spades
 5 of Clubs
 Queen of Hearts
 4 of Diamonds
 Number of picks: 12
