 (Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
 employees are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records an employ-
 eeâ€™s seven-day work hours with seven columns. For example, the following
 array stores the work hours for eight employees. Write a program that displays
 employees and their total hours in decreasing order of the total hours.

            Su M T W Th F Sa

 Employee 1 7 3 4 3 3 4 4
 Employee 2 3 3 4 3 3 2 2

 Employee 4 3 5 4 3 6 3 8

 Employee 6 3 7 4 8 3 8 4
