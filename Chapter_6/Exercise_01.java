 (Math: pentagonal numbers) A pentagonal number is defined as n(3nâ€“1)/2 for
 n = 1, 2, . . ., and so on. Therefore, the first few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, . . . .
 Write a method with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:

 public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)

 Write a test program that uses this method to display the first 100 pentagonal
 numbers with 10 numbers on each line.
